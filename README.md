The purpose of this project is to investigate the statistical performance of the **SigClust** method for testing whether high-dimensional data contains more than one cluster. In particular, we replicate key concepts from:
**Huang, Liu, Yuan, & Marron (2015).**
Statistical Significance of Clustering Using Soft Thresholding.
Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.

The SigClust test is especially useful in high-dimensional, low-sample-size (HDLSS) settings, where traditional clustering validation tools struggle.

# 1. Project Goals
Our goal is to evaluate SigClust under two scenarios:

## 1. Type I Error (Null Case)
